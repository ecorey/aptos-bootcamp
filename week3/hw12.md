# Homework 12
# NFT Module

# Create a module to implement an NFT.

- The module when deployed should create a collection, then an NFT which should be added to the collection.

- The NFT you create should be a named token and have a description, but no royalty.

- The NFT should have a link to a digitial asset (you don't need to create the asset).
